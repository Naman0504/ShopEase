# E-commerce Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind + Pinia (Starter)

Files included: a minimal but working Vue 3 project scaffold using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia.

## Quick setup (run locally)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd ecommerce-vue-tailwind
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This project intentionally **does not** include CDN usage. Use the standard CLI workflow shown above. The product data is an internal JSON file at `src/data/products.json`.

If you want to create the project using `npm init vite@latest` yourself, you can — the included files should work as a drop-in scaffold.
